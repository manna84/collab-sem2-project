## Updates

Implemented MVC pattern to the project. We can add a forum like post page where users can post about their pets to to be adopted by new parents and also other user can click to the post and view all the details in a "Different layout page".
Adding a counter meter will be beneficial to track the number of pets adopted. An increment of +1 when user click the final adopt button.
Chat app with the previous parent to discuss about adoption and more queries.
Please share more ideas
